This notebook can be used to retrieve transcripts from YouTube videos, search in the transcripts for specific words and phrases, extract the audio corresponding to the searched-for utterance, and align the transcript excerpt with the audio. 

The aligned excerpts can then be analyzed and visualized in terms of their acoustic and prosodic properties, for example vowel formant frequencies.

The notebook can be run in the linked Colab environment or on a local machine.

For more information, see Coats (in review).
